# Overview

SocialNetworks (a working project name, subject to change) is a Java library that provides classes and methods to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data from [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/), an online question and answer network with a variety of distinct communities dedicated to topics ranging from [math](http://math.stackexchange.com/) to [music](http://music.stackexchange.com/) to [the workplace](http://workplace.stackexchange.com/) to [religion](http://buddhism.stackexchange.com/).

# What Data does this Project Help Interact With?

This API helps programmers and other analysts interact with the Stack Exchange Data Dump.  You can download the [March 1, 2016 data dump here](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) and learn about [the data dump's schema here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede).

# Acknowledgements

The idea for this project and the vast majority of code is mine.

However, this project was initiated as the captstone for the class "Capstone: Analyzing (Social) Network Data", which is the last class of the Java Programming: Object Oriented Design of Data Structures Specialization offered by University of California, San Diego (UCSD) on Coursera.

Although no code and no instruction was directly provided for this project, the USCD MOOC Team, consisting of (at least) Mia Minnes, Christine Alvarado, Leo Porter, Alec Brickner, and Adam Setters, provided some skeleton starter code in the following files to help with completing a few programming assignments early in the course:

graph.Graph.java
graph.CapGraph.java
util.GraphLoader.java (but only the loadGraph() method)
graph.grader.Grader.java
graph.grader.EgoGrader.java
graph.grader.SCCGrader.java

They also provided several data files that can be found in the /data directory.

Many thanks to the UCSD Mooc Team for putting these materials together, providing them under the open source MIT License, and sparking some ideas.
